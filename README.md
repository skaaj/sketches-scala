# sketches-scala
Collection of visual sketches made with Scala + Processing.

## Running
For some reason the applet is auto-closed when running `sbt run`. A workaround to this is simply to open a sbt shell
```
sbt
```
and then run the application
```
> run
```

### Note
The project is using an unofficial maven dependency (more info [here](https://github.com/micycle1/processing-core-4)).
In case that dependency is not available it is possible to directly build and use the library jar from [processing4](https://github.com/processing/processing4).
